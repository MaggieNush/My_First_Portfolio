      seeing user interfaces come to life through lines of codes

        >ALX Frontend Program</a
      >
      began a month ago, I was introduced to the git commands plus revamping my
      online presence, I later got into depth on the basics of git and github
      commands. It was really fun especially working with branches then merging
      them. I was later introduced to JavaScript which was a bit intimidating at
      first but later got sweeter and I enjoyed every bit of it.
