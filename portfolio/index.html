      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        My background is in Graphic Design where I have worked for a juice
        company in Donholm as both their digital marketer as well as their
        designer. Working at that company has equipped me with skills of
        actively listening to clients and handle their concerns, I have also
        gained problem solving skills where I handle the customers' concerns
        delicately and find ways to resolve the issues raised. It's been a
        challenging yet enlightening moment working there.
